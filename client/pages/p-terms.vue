But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
			<h1>Governing Law</h1>
			<p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
